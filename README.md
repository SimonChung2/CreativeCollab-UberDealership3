# CreativeCollab-UberDealership3

The UberDealership Project is an ongoing creative collaboration between Simon Chung and Revathi Ravi where 2 concepts were merged to create a more interesting concept. 

The first concept was a car dealership application which allowed users to:
  - view a list of all cars available at all dealers
  - create, update, and delete a car
  - view a list of all car models
  - create, update, and delete a car model
  - view a list of all dealers
  - create, update, and delete a dealer
    
  - view a list of cars available at a particular dealer
  - view a list of cars available of a particular car model

The second concept was an UberDrive application which allowed users to:
  - view a list of all cars available
  - create, update, and delete a car
  - view a list of all drivers available
  - create, update, and delete a driver
  - view a list of all rides available

## The merged collaborative concept:

The car dealership application would allow users to view all available cars for sale at multiple dealerships all in one website. However, there are certain times when car sales are slow, which results in a lot of idle inventory. Instead of letting their cars sit idly in their parking lots, the dealers have decided to partner their businesses with UberDrive. This would allow Uber drivers who can’t afford to buy their own cars to use a car from a dealer. In return, a small portion of the profits that the drivers make will go to the dealership.
A member of the public who wishes to buy a car may also want to utilize UberDrive’s services since they do not own a car. This application would allow them to view available rides to help them get to their desired location while getting a ride in a car that they may be interested in buying. This would allow them to have the opportunity to observe the car before making the purchase.

The following functionalities are included in the project

  -Create, Read, Update, Delete Cars
  -Create, Read, Update, Delete Rides
  -Create, Read, Update, Delete Drivers
  -Create, Read, Update, Delete Models
  -Create, Read, Update, Delete Dealers
  -Related CRUD:
    -ListCarsForDealer
    -ListCarsForModel
    -ListCarsForDriver

## Authentification

Authentification was also included in this project. A non-registered user can only access the read functionalities such as viewing a list of cars, rides, or models but will not be able to perform any create, update or delete actions.
A registered, logged-in user would be able to perform any create, read, update or delete action.
